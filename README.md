# CardLabeler

Makes using GitHub Project to manage GitHub Issues sane.

- Automatically set labels according to an Issue's column in Project
- Automatically add new Issues into a specified default column
  - Or add Issues into correct column according to labels it already has
- Automatically close issues in a specified column

Originated for managing [this](https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/projects/1) and [this](https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/issues).
